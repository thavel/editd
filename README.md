# editd

`editd` is a lightweight publisher-side client to [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) focused on:

* publishing new configs.
* keeping key-values stored in etcd up-to-date with the local configurations.

This tool is the missing link between a system and its etcd-[confd](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd) cluster.
